### Structure of the Site
The Hyphal Health website is designed to provide visitors with valuable information about medicinal mushrooms, while also encouraging them to make purchases or inquiries. To achieve this dual purpose, we've designed a multipage website that allows for easy navigation and information consumption.

The homepage provides a clear overview of Hyphal Health's mission and products, with direct links to the product pages for those who are ready to make a purchase. The navigation bar at the top of the site is fixed, making it easy for users to move around the site quickly.

In addition to product pages, we've included a blog section on the site. This section allows Hyphal Health to establish itself as an authority in the medicinal mushroom space, providing visitors with educational content and the latest news in the industry. This not only helps to attract and retain visitors, but it also provides opportunities to optimize the site for search engines.

Overall, the structure of the Hyphal Health website is intended to provide a seamless user experience while also achieving business objectives. It's designed to provide information, establish authority, and ultimately drive conversions.
